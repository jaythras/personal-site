								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>I'm a computer science major and mathematics minor at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis. Before I fell in love with computer science, I studied psychology. In my psychology program, I took a data analysis course where I learned the R programming language. This was my first taste of computer science, but I immediately knew that I needed to learn more. That next semester I began taking computer science courses, and decided that this was the career path for me. When I am not behind a monitor, I love learning how to create new things with my hands and traveling.</p>

								<h2>ClearObject Business </br>
								Intelligence Engine</h2>
								<p>This was a project that I created during my internship with ClearObject. COBIE is a data aggregator built to help company executives make more informed decisions using company metrics. Before COBIE was implemented, company data was spread across various external tools. By integrating all of these external  tools through various APIs, I was able to create a custom dashboard to assist in cross referencing and making sense of company wide metrics.</p>

								<h2>Arcade Cabinet</h2>
								<p>The arcade cabinet is a long standing project that we have been working on in the Computer Science Club at IUPUI. The entire AC menu as well as the games that it runs are entirely student made. After this project is complete, we plan to permanently move a full size arcade cabinet into the campus center game room so that CS students can show off there games to students in other majors, and to raise brand awareness for the CS Club.</p>
